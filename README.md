## What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

  Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
  Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
  Update attributes of an object
  Destroy an object
